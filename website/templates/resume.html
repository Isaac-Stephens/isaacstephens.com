      <p>When I’m not coding, I lift heavy circles as a powerlifter, worldbuild for my ongoing D&D campaigns, explore new open-source projects, and keep my home network running efficiently with as little money as possible (lol this server is running off a $15 computer from the S&T surplus store, and I love it that way). I'm also an active member of the Baptist Student Union at Missouri S&T where I serve on the worship team :)</p>
